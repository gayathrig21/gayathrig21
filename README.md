### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm [Gayathri Gopalsami](http://my-django-portfolioapp.herokuapp.com/portfolio/GayathriG), located in Hyderabad India, a **passionate Software Engineer** and a **Data Science Enthusiast**. I have 11+ years of experience as a Sr.Software Engineer in the IT industry specializing in backend development predominantly working with Oracle DataBases.

As an individual with a strong belief that **the data isnâ€™t just data** always seeking for the more story that a data can reveal and thrive on its challenges. This brought me to deep dive into a new branch of science - Data Science. 

I seek to learn every day. I also believe that the best way to learn something is to teach and share the knowledge with others. I write articles on Medium about the topics related to Data Science. It fuels my mind and the responses keep me motivated. This is my way of going deeper into the subject that matters.
