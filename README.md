### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gayathri Gopalsami, a **passionate Software Engineer** and a **Data Science Enthusiast**. I have 11 years of experience as Sr.Software Engineer in IT industry specializing in backend development predominantly with Oracle DB.
As an individual with strong belief that **the data isnâ€™t just data** always seeking for the more story that a data can reveal and thrive on the challenges it presents. This brought me to deep dive into a new branch of science - Data Science. 
I also believe that best way to learn something is to teach and share the knowledge with others. I write on Medium about the topics related to Data Science.
