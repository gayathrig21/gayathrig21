### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Gayathri Gopalsami](http://my-django-portfolioapp.herokuapp.com/portfolio/GayathriG), located at Hyderabad India, a **passionate Software Engineer** and a **Data Science Enthusiast**. I have 11 years of experience as Sr.Software Engineer in IT industry specializing in backend development predominantly with Oracle DB.

As an individual with strong belief that **the data isnâ€™t just data** always seeking for the more story that a data can reveal and thrive on the challenges it presents. This brought me to deep dive into a new branch of science - Data Science. 

I also believe that best way to learn something is to teach and share the knowledge with others. I write articles on Medium about the topics related to Data Science. This is my way of going deeper in the subject that matters.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other Data Science Enthusiasts / Data Scientists
